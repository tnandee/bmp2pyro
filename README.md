# bmp2pyro
Converts 24bit bmp to gcodes to feed a pyrograph

### Requirements
- Python3
- Pillow package

### Bmp preparation
- Handles only 24bit bmp files
- You have to manipulate the picture to have lead-in, lead-out. 
    -   I highly recommend to use paint.net for this
    -   Could be implemented in code, but as you probably should have to change the picture(black and white levels, gammma, ...) to achive a proper print. Maybe implemented later...
